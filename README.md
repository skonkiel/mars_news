## Mission to Mars
This challenge tested our ability to scrape data from a series of websites, store it locally in a MongoDB database, then repurpose the scraped data
into a webpage that contains facts and images about Mars.

This Flask app uses `splinter` (Selenium), MongoDB, `Beautiful Soup` and `Pandas`. It was designed using `Bootstrap`.
